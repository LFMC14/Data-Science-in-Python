# The Github History of the Scala Language

I make use of the pandas library to manipulate the data and use it to see how active the Scala project is on GitHub and who are the most frequent contributors.

1. pulls_2011-2013.csv contains the basic information about the pull requests, and spans from the end of 2011 up to (but not including) 2014.
2. pulls_2014-2018.csv contains identical information, and spans from 2014 up to 2018.
3. pull_files.csv contains the files that were modified by each pull request.
